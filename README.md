 ## ANALYSIS AND INSIGHTS

### Calendar Table

The first thing I did while starting to analyze the data was creating a calendar table. The calendar table helped me in performing accurate and flexible **time-based analysis**. It allowed me to easily perform date-related calculations such as Year-to-Date (YTD), Month-to-Date (MTD), and Year-on-year (YOY), as well as compare data across different time periods.

<br>

First I created a table named **Calendar table**; 
``` dax
CALENDAR TABLE = CALENDAR(MIN(car_data[Date]), max(car_data[Date]))
```
The formula generated a range of dates based on the earliest and latest dates found in the "car_data" table under the "Date" column in a new table.

Then I extracted the **month, year and week** from the designated column, using the following formulas:

``` dax
--- for year
Year = YEAR('CALENDAR TABLE'[Date].[Date])

--- for month
Month = FORMAT('CALENDAR TABLE'[Date], "MMMM")

--- for week
Week = WEEKNUM('CALENDAR TABLE'[Date].[Date])
```
<br>
<br>

A quick look at the Calendar Table:

<br>
<br>

To establish a relationship between the car_data table and the newly created Calendar table, I connected the tables through the common field which is **Date**.
In the calendar table, each date appeared only once, denoted by the symbol '1', while in the car_data table some dates might have appeared multiple times, indicated by the symbol '*'. Which signified a **One-to-Many** relationship between the two tables.

<br>
<br>

Then, to address the key objectives of this project, I created KPI cards and visualization charts. These visuals offer a focused view of sales patterns, regional strengths, and customer preferences.

### KPI CARDS

I used **DAX measures** to create these KPI cards, offering quick insights into key metrics like total sales, average price, and cars sold.

- **Sales Overview :**

   **Year-to-Date (YTD) Total Sales** : It is the cumulative sales from the **start of the year to the current date**, used to track sales performance within the year. YTD 
     Total sales is **$371.2M**.

  ``` dax
        YTD Total Sales = TOTALYTD(SUM(car_data[Price ($)]), 'CALENDAR TABLE'[Date])
   ```
   
   **Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Sales** : The Month-to-Date (MTD) total sales show the sales generated within the **current month**. It allows for tracking monthly 
     performance. MTD Total Sales **$54.28M**

  ``` dax
        MTD Total Sales = TOTALMTD(SUM(car_data[Price ($)]), 'CALENDAR TABLE'[Date])
   ```

   **Previous-year-to-date (PYTD) Total Sales** : refers to the total sales accumulated from the beginning of the previous year up to the same date as the current year of 
     the privious year. It serves as a benchmark to **compare** the current Year-to-Date (YTD) sales performance with the same period in the previous year, helping 
     businesses assess growth, decline, or consistency in sales trends over time.

  ``` dax
        PYTD Total Sales = CALCULATE(SUM(car_data[Price ($)]), SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('CALENDAR TABLE'[Date]))
   ```

   **Difference between YTD Sales and Previous Year-to-Date (PTYD) Sales** : Difference between the current year's sales and it's previous year's sales. There was an 
     increement of **$70.8M** in sales in the current year compared to the previous year. 
     
  ``` dax
        Sales Difference = [YTD Total Sales] - [PYTD Total Sales]
   ```

   **Year-over-Year (YOY) Growth in Total Sales** : It refers to the **comparison** of total sales during a specific period in one year with the same period in the previous 
     year. This metric helps evaluate growth or decline in sales performance over time. There was a **23.59% growth** in sales in the current year compared to the previous 
     period.

  ``` dax
        YOY Sales Growth = [Sales Difference]/ [PYTD Total Sales]
   ```
<br>

   Similarly, I calculated all these metrics for Average price and number of Cars sold.

<br>

- **Average Price Analysis :**

    First, I calculated the average price.
  
  ``` dax
        Avg Price = SUM(car_data[Price ($)]) / COUNT(car_data[Car_id])
   ```

   **YTD Average Price** : YTD Average Price helps businesses track pricing trends, assess profitability, and compare pricing performance against previous years or periods. 
     The YTD average price is **$28.0K**.

  ``` dax
        YTD Avg Price = TOTALYTD([Avg Price], 'CALENDAR TABLE'[Date])
   ```
  
   **MTD Average Price** : The average price per car sold Month-to-Date, indicates how recent sales prices compare to the overall YTD prices. The MTD average price is  
   **$28.26K**    

  ``` dax
        MTD Avg Price = TOTALMTD([Avg Price], 'CALENDAR TABLE'[Date])
   ```

   **Previous-year-to-date (PYTD) Average price** : refers to the average selling price of products or services from the beginning of the previous year up to the same date 
     as the current year. 

  ``` dax
       PYTD Avg Price = CALCULATE([Avg Price], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('CALENDAR TABLE'[Date]))
   ```

   **Difference between YTD Average Price and PTYD Average Price** : There was a small decrease of **$0.22K** in average price in the current year compared to the previous 
     year.

  ``` dax
       Avg Price Diff = [YTD Avg Price] - [PYTD Avg Price]
   ```

   **YOY Growth in Average Price** : There was a **(-0.79%)** change in average price in the current year compared to the previous period.

  ``` dax
       YOY Avg Price Growth = [Avg Price Diff] / [PYTD Avg Price]
   ```

<br>

- **Cars Sold Metrics :**

   **YTD Cars Sold** : The total number of cars sold YTD was **13K**.

  ``` dax
       YTD Cars sold = TOTALYTD(COUNT(car_data[Car_id]), 'CALENDAR TABLE'[Date])
   ```

   **MTD Cars Sold** : This shows the number of cars sold in the current month that is **2K**, giving insights into monthly sales trends. 

  ``` dax
       MTD Cars sold = TOTALMTD(COUNT(car_data[Car_id]), 'CALENDAR TABLE'[Date])
   ```

   **Previous-year-to-date (PYTD) Cars sold** : Calculates the number of cars sold from the beginning of the previous year up to the same date as the current year. 

  ``` dax
       PYTD Cars sold = CALCULATE(COUNT(car_data[Car_id]) , SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('CALENDAR TABLE'[Date]))
   ```

   **Difference between YTD Cars Sold and PTYD Cars Sold** : **3 thousand** more cars were sold in the current year compared to the previous year.

  ``` dax
       Cars sold Diff = [YTD Cars sold] - [PYTD Cars sold]
   ```

   **YOY Growth in Cars Sold** : a **24.57%** increase, demonstrates strong performance in sales volume.

  ``` dax
       YOY Cars sold Growth = [Cars sold Diff] / [PYTD Cars sold]
   ```

<br>

### CHARTS

**1. YTD Sales Weekly Trend:**

- A line chart showing weekly sales trends throughout the year. Peaks and troughs in the chart highlight seasonal or promotional effects on sales. For example, there is a 
  peak at week **36** with **$14.9M** sales, indicating **high sales** during that time.

**2. YTD Total Sales by Body Style:**

- A donut chart that breaks down total sales YTD by different car body styles (e.g., SUV, Sedan, Hatchback, etc.). This chart gives insights into which body styles are more 
  popular among customers. **SUVs** seem to have the **largest share** of **$99.9M** total sales, followed by Sedans and Hatchbacks.

**3. YTD Total Sales by Color:**

- Another donut chart visualizing total car sales YTD categorized by color (e.g., Black, Red, Pale White). It helps understand customer preferences regarding car color. For 
  instance, **Pale white** cars seem to be the **most popular** with a total sale of **$174.5M**.

<br>

### MAP

- **YTD Cars Sold by Dealer Region:**

- A geographic map that shows the total number of cars sold by dealer location across different regions. The size of the circles represents sales volume in each region, 
  with larger circles indicating higher sales. For example, **Austin and Janesville** regions had **higher sales** compared to 
  others with **2296** and **2113** number of cars sold , making these regions key sales areas.

<br>

### COMPANY-WISE SALES TREND GRID

- This grid provides detailed information on a per-company basis. It shows the **YTD average price** per car, the **number of cars sold**, **total sales**, and the **percentage growth in total sales** compared to the previous period for each car manufacturer (e.g., Acura, Audi, BMW).
  
- This table helps identify which car companies are performing well and contributing most to overall sales. For example, **Chevrolet** seems to have the largest YTD sales total **(27.1M)** and a **7.30% growth** in it's total sales.

<br>

### FILTERS

**1. Body Style:**

- Allows users to filter the dashboard by the specific body style of cars (e.g., SUV, Sedan). This helps to focus on a particular category of cars and analyze sales trends 
  for that specific style.
  
**2. Dealer Name:**

- This filter enables users to view sales data based on individual dealers. It can provide insights into dealer-specific performance.
  
**3. Transmission:**

- A filter for transmission type (e.g., manual or automatic), allowing users to analyze sales data according to the preference for different types of car transmissions.
  
**4. Engine:**

- Filters the data based on engine type, providing insights into the popularity of different car engine technologies (e.g., Overhead Camshaft, Double Overhead Camshaft).

<br>

I have also created an another dashboard that displays a matrix providing detailed transaction-level data of the purchased cars. It includes columns for **Car ID** (unique identifier), **Date of purchase**, **Customer Name**, **Dealer Name**, **Company** (car manufacturer), **Color**, **Model**, and the **Total Sales** amount for each transaction. 

The matrix allows for a granular view of individual sales, making it **easy to track specific car sales** across different customers, dealers, and regions, and offers insights into the performance of various models and colors.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

<br>

**1. Focus on High-Performing Regions**

- **Insight**: Regions like Austin, Janesville, and Scottsdale are showing higher sales volumes compared to others.
  
- **Recommendation**: The company should continue investing in marketing and sales efforts in these high-performing regions by offering **region-specific promotions**, 
  **increasing inventory**, and **improving customer service** to sustain and further grow sales.

**2. Capitalize on SUV Demand**

- **Insight**: SUVs make up a significant portion of YTD total sales.
  
- **Recommendation**: To capitalize on this demand, the company should increase its focus on **SUV inventory**, **prioritize SUV marketing campaigns**, and **offer 
  attractive financing or leasing deals** for SUV models. This could further boost sales in this popular segment.

**3. Leverage Pale White Cars' Popularity**

- **Insight**: Pale White is the most popular color for cars sold YTD.
  
- **Recommendation**: The company should ensure that sufficient inventory of pale white-colored cars is available to meet customer demand. Additionally, offering **custom 
  styling** or **upgrades** for these cars could attract even more buyers.

**4. Strengthen Partnerships with Chevrolet and Ford**

- **Insight**: Chevrolet and Ford are the top-performing car manufacturers in terms of YTD sales.

- **Recommendation**: the company should focus on building stronger relationships with these manufacturers. This could involve **negotiating better dealership terms**, 
  **securing exclusive models**, or **increasing the inventory of popular models** from these brands to meet growing demand.

**5. Targeted Promotions for Low-Selling Regions**

- **Insight**: Regions such as Pasco and Scottsdale show lower sales volumes.

- **Recommendation**: The company should run region-specific promotions and marketing campaigns in these underperforming regions to **increase brand awareness** and attract 
  more customers. Offering **region-specific discounts** or **financing options** could help improve sales performance in these areas.

**6. Increase Focus on Automatic Transmission Cars**

- **Insight**: Automatic transmission cars are likely to be more popular based on general market trends (if data supports this from the Transmission filter).
  
- **Recommendation**: The company should **prioritize stocking automatic transmission cars** to meet customer preferences, and provide easy access to inventory across 
  regions to drive sales in this category.

**7. Monitor and Adjust Pricing Strategies**
   
- **Insight**: The YTD average price had slightly decreased (-0.79%), which could indicate competitive pressure or changing customer preferences.
  
- **Recommendation**: The company should regularly review its pricing strategy to stay competitive while maintaining profitability.**Offering value-added services** like 
  **extended warranties**, **free maintenance**, or **tech upgrades at no extra cost** could help in maintaining current prices while **enhancing the perceived value** 
  rather than engaging in price wars.

**8. Monthly Sales Promotions**

- **Insight**: MTD sales indicate fluctuations in monthly performance.
  
- **Recommendation**: Running monthly or seasonal sales campaigns, such as end-of-year or summer promotions, could help smooth out sales fluctuations and increase MTD sales 
  performance. **Offering limited-time discounts** or **financing deals** could help drive more consistent monthly growth.

**9. Promote low selling Car Color**

- **Insight**: While pale white and black cars are the most popular, red also show demand, albeit smaller share.
 
- **Recommendation**: The company could consider offering **special deals or limited-time promotions** to move inventory in the less popular color. Highlighting unique 
  styling options or offering discounts for the color may attract customers looking for more distinct car options.

<br>

## CONCLUSION

<br>

Since Red and other colors have lower sales, the company could consider offering special deals or limited-time promotions to move inventory in these less popular colors. Highlighting unique styling options or offering discounts for these colors may attract customers looking for more distinct car options.
